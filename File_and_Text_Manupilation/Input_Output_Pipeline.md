In PowerShell, the echo is actually an alias for Write-Output.  We know the echo command prints out our keyboard input to the screen.

Every Windows process and every PowerShell command can take input and can produce output. To do this, we use something known as I/O streams or input/output streams. 
Each process and Windows has three different streams, standard in, standard out, and standard error. It's helpful to think of these streams like actual water streams in a river. You provide input to a process by adding things to the standard instream, which flows into the process. When the process creates output, it adds data to the standard out stream, which flows out of the process. At the CLI, the input that you provide through the keyboard goes to the standard instream of the process that you're interacting with. This happens whether that's PowerShell, a text editor or anything else. The process then communicates back to you by putting data into the standard out stream, which the CLA writes out on the screen that you're looking at. Now, what if instead of seeing the output of the command on the screen, we want it to save it to a file. The greater than symbol is something we call a redirect or operator that lets us change where we want our standard output to go. Instead of sending standard out to the screen, we can send standard out to a file. If the file exists, it will override it for us. Otherwise, it will make a new file. If we don't want to overwrite an existing file, there's another redirect or operator we can use to append information greater than, greater than. Let's see that in action. Echo woof>> dog.txt. Now if I look at my dog.txt file again, we can see that woof was added again. But what if we wanted to send the output of one command to the input of another command. For this, we're going to use the pipe operator. First, let's take a look at what's in this file. Cat words.txt. Look at that, it's a list of words. Now what if we want to just lift the words that contain the string st? We could do what we've done before and just use the select-string or SLS on the file directly. This time, let's use the pipeline to pass the output of cat to the input of select-string, cat, words.txt, pipe, select-string st. Now we can see a list of words with the string st. To tie things together, we can use output redirection to put our new list into a file. Now greater than and then a new file called st_words.txt. Now if I cat st_words.txt, there it is. That's just a very basic example of how you can take several simple tools and combine them together to do complex tasks. Now we're going to learn about the last I/O redirector standard error. Remember when we tried to remove a restricted system file earlier and we got an error that said permission denied. Let's review that once more. This time I'm going to remove another protected file, rm secure_file.
